- **.gitignore**: Configuration file specifying files and directories to ignore in version control.
- **.gitattributes**: Configuration file specifying Git attributes, such as filters for Jupyter notebooks.

# Getting Started

To ensure no outputs from Jupyter Notebooks are committed to the repo, a filter has been created and is located within the .gitattributes file to remove outputs upon staging of the file. To add this filter to your local git configuration, open a terminal, navigate to the local repo and enter the following line:

```cmd
git config filter.clear_notebook_output.clean "jupyter nbconvert --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True --to notebook --inplace"
```

_Note: This filter runs on a file every time it is staged._

# Contributing

To contribute to this repository:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a feature branch - be descriptive
3. Ensure you have configured git correctly
4. Commit your changes
5. Publish your branch/push your most recent changes
6. Open a pull request into main - each request **must** be reviewed by a team maintainer

Ensure you follow best practices when using Git/GitHub, such as:

1. Never commit anything sensitive such as passwords or real data
2. Use meaningful commit messages
3. Commit frequently
4. Do not commit Jupyter Notebook outputs
